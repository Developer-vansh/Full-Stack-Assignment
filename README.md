# Technology Used
1. React
2. Node.js with Express.js
3. MongoDb
4. JWT Tokens
5. Bcrypt For Password Hashing

# Bonus Points
1. Added rate limiting to protect against brute force attacks.
2. Used middleware for authentication and authorization.
3. Added password visibility toggle.
4. Writen unit tests for API endpoints.

# Best Practices Followed:
1. Enforced input validation and sanitization to prevent vulnerabilities.
2. Protect against brute force attacks.
3. Securely store passwords using strong hashing algorithm i.e. bcrypt.
4. Implemented proper error handling and provided informative error messages.
5. Writeen clean, well-structured, and documented code.
6. Used environment variables for sensitive information.
7. Handled sessions and token expiration effectively.
